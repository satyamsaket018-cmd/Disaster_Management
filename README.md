## 📌 Problem Statement

During natural disasters, the biggest challenge is **organizing rescue operations efficiently**. Victims can't reach help easily, volunteers don't know where to go first, and NGOs don't know where aid is needed most. ResQNet solves this by creating a unified platform where every stakeholder — victims, volunteers, NGOs, and administrators — can coordinate in real time.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🆘 For Victims
- Emergency registration form with name, phone, email, location, and injury details
- Automatic **priority score calculation** based on severity and urgency
- Real-time rescue status tracker with ticket ID
- Step-by-step status updates: Submitted → Reviewing → Assigned → Dispatched

### ⛑️ For Volunteers
- Registration with skills, specialization, and availability
- Priority-sorted task queue — highest-score locations first
- Sequential task unlock system (complete Task 1 to unlock Task 2)
- Live dashboard with Leaflet map showing all active incidents

### 🏛️ For NGOs
- Organization registration with capacity and past experience
- Aid offer submission (food, shelter, medical, rescue, etc.)
- Live dashboard access with incident overview

### 🛡️ For Admins
- Secure login with email + password + 6-digit admin code
- Full dashboard with live MongoDB stats
- Assign volunteers to victims directly from the panel
- Priority-sorted victim list updated in real time

### 🗺️ Dashboard (Volunteer / NGO / Admin only)
- **Leaflet.js map** with color-coded incident markers (red = critical, amber = high, green = medium)
- Real-time incident sidebar sorted by priority score
- Submit new incident reports from the dashboard
- Live stats ticker (active incidents, critical count, affected people)
- Socket.io powered real-time updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or higher
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local installation)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khushbu677/Disaster_Management.git
cd Disaster_Management
```

**2. Set up the backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**3. Configure environment variables**

Create/edit the `.env` file inside `backend/`


**4. Set up the React dashboard**
```bash
cd "Disaster Management"
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Open **3 terminals** simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Start MongoDB
mongod

# Terminal 2 — Start backend API (http://localhost:5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 — Start React dashboard (http://localhost:3000)
cd "Disaster Management"
npm start
```

Then open `resqnet.html` directly in your browser — no server needed.

## 🔄 User Flow

```
resqnet.html (Landing Page)
        │
        ├── 🆘 VICTIM ──────► Registration Form ──► Status Tracker (NO dashboard access)
        │
        ├── ⛑️ VOLUNTEER ───► Registration Form ──► Dashboard + Map + Task Queue
        │
        ├── 🏛️ NGO ─────────► Registration Form ──► Dashboard + Map + Aid Offer Form
        │
        └── 🛡️ ADMIN ────────► Secure Login ───────► Dashboard + Map + Admin Panel
```

> **Role-based access control:** Victims are completely blocked from the command dashboard. Only Volunteers, NGOs, and Admins can see the live map and incident data.

## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

- Built the React.js frontend
- Design the basic UI and UI componenets
- Managed environmental variables and secure Vercel and Render
- Developed the SOS priority scoring algorithm with time decay and priority level classification 
- Contributed to testing , debugging and UI improvements

## 🔒 Security

- Passwords are hashed using **bcryptjs** before storing in MongoDB
- All dashboard routes protected by **JWT tokens**
- **Role-based middleware** blocks victims from accessing rescue command data
- Admin login requires email + password + 6-digit security code
